# Flappy Bird
This is my version of Flappy Bird, because I've been very bored over winter break and Raylib is really fun. This one was a lot easier than Tetris, haha.
Make Flappy fly by pressing the spacebar or clicking your mouse.
To play, write `make run` in the terminal; make sure to have Raylib installed! Enjoy!
